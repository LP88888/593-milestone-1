This project focuses on sports analytics, specifically analyzing soccer
(association football) player performance, statistics, and market value. The aim is to
investigate how a playerâ€™s on-field performance influences their market value and
transfer fees. Soccer, being one of the most popular sports worldwide, has an extensive
amount of player and game-related data, yet the relationship between these statistics
and a player's market value is not fully understood.
